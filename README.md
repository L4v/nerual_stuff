# My attempts at neural networks
## Steve (fetus)
My first attempt at Steve, the single neuron that could!

## Steve (mind)
Steve's little grown-up brain!

## Steve
Implementation of Steve's brain, can predict a simple boolean function with
3 parameters! (HINT: if the first parameter is 1, the result is 1)

## Steven (prototype)
Prototype of Steven, the neural network that can, hopefully, recognize 8-bit
handwritten digits!
